### The Office
> N: Our story begins in the busy offices of New York. Nothing beyond the ordinary, but our protagonist is feeling a bit down more than his daily dose of depression.

> R?|Wesly: Acting for five minutes like Janice doesn't make all our lives miserable is the hardest work i'll do all day. My job title is Account Manager. I used to be called an Account Service Representative. But a consultant told us we need to manage our clients and not service them. I find it hard to care about anything these days. In fact the only thing that I care about is the fact that I can't care about anything. Seriously, it worries me.

> R|Wesly: My dad walked out of my mom when I was 7 days old. Sometimes I wonder if he ever looked at my baby blue eyes and and asked himself.

> L??|Cross: I have a new perspective for the fraternity.
> R|Mr. X: You don't destroy something that's been around for a thousand years.
> L??|Cross: It's already destroyed. He broke the code, I have to stop this.
> R|Mr. X: Really...
> L??|Cross: You know this.
> R|Mr. X: So why don't you face me yourself? Never send sheep to kill a wolf.
